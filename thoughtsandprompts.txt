when seed is planted in dirt a timestamp should start and the user should have the asset locked in place until
they confirm through an attestation and updating a picture of the batch of seeds to the metadata and confirming onchain that the seed was planted and

when the seed shows its sprout a picture should be uploaded by the user and an attestation should be put onchain. 
the sprout when confirmed to be alive and well the timestamp should restart and be kept for mapping the next phase of the process. 

when the seed shows its sex or it flowers/fruits the user will then fill out another attestation onchain confirming whether its a flower or a pollenator 
each sprout gets a new label being a 0 for flower a 1 for pollenator or 2 for self pollenator/or seedless. 

the 0 can be pollenated by 1 and 2 and the 1 can also pollenate 2. 1's can not produce S33DS when put in the B0x but they do produce pollen
pollen is collected and and can be used to pollenate nearly an infinite amount of flowers(0's and 2's) in theory...in real life this will 
be hard to track and our system will have to figure out a way to validate pollenations and build a community of trust and practice in keeping
data true and immutable.
