This protocol is a novel approach to biological asset represntation on chain and is an attempt at rethinking the  creation and management of real life items on Ethereum. It is designed around the theme of planting and harvesting, and is a metaphor for creating and managing unique digital assets. but it is important to note that this could be used to organize any biological species going through a breeding process(I.e. Dogs, Cats, Birds, all plants, especially flowering and fruiting plants. 

Key Components
S33D (Seed) Contract: This contract is an ERC721 token (Non-Fungible Token). Each unique seed (S33D) token has unique properties such as genus, species, and variety. The initialize function allows the owner to set these properties.

S33DSFactory Contract: This contract serves as a factory for creating new S33D contracts (i.e., new seed tokens). It deploys a new S33D contract for each seed using the Create2 function, which allows a contract to be deployed at a predictable address. This factory contract tracks the deployed S33D contracts and emits an event when a new S33D contract is created.

Sprout Contract: This contract is another ERC721 token, representing a "sprouted" seed. This sprouted seed or plant has properties such as plantType, flowerCount, genus, species, and variety. The state of the plant can be changed over time using various functions.

D1RT (Dirt) Contract: This contract allows a S33D token to be planted and thus turned into a Sprout token. The contract burns the S33D token and creates a new Sprout token.

Key Concepts


Planting a Seed: The planting process is metaphorical. It involves burning a S33D (ERC721 token) and deploying a new Sprout contract. This process of burning and deploying a new contract mimics the real-world process of a seed turning into a plant.

Flowering and Pollination: The Sprout contract has the ability to start the flowering process and the plant can then be pollinated.

Cloning and Harvesting: The Sprout contract also has the functionality of being cloned and harvested. The harvest function creates new S33D contracts for each flower on the plant. The cloneSprout function creates a new Sprout contract, mimicking the propagation of plants in the real world.

Technical Strengths
Efficient Use of EIPs and Libraries: The protocol efficiently uses ERC721 standard for NFTs, the OpenZeppelin contracts for secure contract development, and the Create2 function for predictable contract deployment.

Code Reusability: The use of interfaces and factory contracts promotes code reusability.

Detailed State Management: The state of the Sprout contract is meticulously managed, mimicking the lifecycle of a plant.

Areas of Improvement
Code Modularity: The contracts could be split up more to improve modularity. For instance, the actions of flowering, pollination, and harvesting could each be their own contract.

Access Controls: Currently, most actions can only be performed by the contract owner. It might be beneficial to add more roles and permissions.

Additional Validation: Some functions lack rigorous validation. For instance, the cloneSprout function does not check if the plant has already been cloned.

Event Logging: More events could be emitted to allow for better off-chain tracking of contract interactions.
